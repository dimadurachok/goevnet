"Doom," released in 1993 by id Software, is one of the most influential first-person shooter games, introducing many players to fast-paced action, immersive level design, and multiplayer deathmatches, which became a standard for the genre.
The original "Doom" game features the player as a space marine, often referred to as Doomguy, who must battle hordes of demons and undead soldiers after a teleportation experiment goes wrong on the Martian moon Phobos.
"Doom" is known for its revolutionary use of 3D graphics, albeit with a 2D sprite system for enemies and objects, which allowed it to run smoothly on the hardware of the early 1990s while still delivering an intense and immersive experience.
The game introduced the concept of the "WAD" file, a file format that allowed players to create and share custom levels, effectively laying the groundwork for a vibrant modding community that continues to thrive to this day.
The success of "Doom" led to the creation of numerous sequels, including "Doom II: Hell on Earth," which was released in 1994 and expanded on the original game's formula with new weapons, enemies, and a larger variety of levels.
"Doom II" features the iconic double-barreled shotgun, or "Super Shotgun," which became a fan favorite due to its powerful blast capable of taking down multiple enemies at once, adding a new strategic element to the gameplay.
The storyline of "Doom II" follows the Doomguy as he returns to Earth, only to find it overrun by demons, requiring him to fight his way through the devastated landscape and ultimately travel into Hell to stop the invasion at its source.
Unlike the episodic structure of the first "Doom," "Doom II" is presented as a continuous campaign, which creates a more seamless experience as players progress from one level to the next without returning to a main menu.
"Doom II" is also notable for introducing several new enemies, including the fearsome Arch-vile, which can resurrect fallen demons, adding a new layer of challenge and strategy to the encounters.
Both "Doom" and "Doom II" have been widely ported to various platforms over the years, including consoles, handheld devices, and even calculators, making them some of the most accessible and enduring video games in history.
The popularity of the "Doom" series led to the development of a variety of spin-offs and adaptations, including novels, comics, and a feature film, although the games themselves remain the most critically acclaimed elements of the franchise.
"Heretic," released in 1994 by Raven Software and published by id Software, was built on the same engine as "Doom" but introduced a dark fantasy setting and new gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to look up and down, and an inventory system for items.
In "Heretic," players take on the role of Corvus, an Elven hero fighting against the evil forces of D'Sparil, one of the three Serpent Riders who have enslaved the world of Parthoris with their dark magic.
"Heretic" differentiates itself from "Doom" with its focus on a medieval fantasy atmosphere, featuring weapons like enchanted staffs and tomes of power, as well as enemies drawn from mythological and supernatural sources.
The game's use of an inventory system allows players to carry and use items like health potions, invulnerability rings, and the Morph Ovum, which hilariously transforms enemies into helpless chickens.
The success of "Heretic" led to the development of a sequel, "Hexen: Beyond Heretic," which continued the story of the Serpent Riders and expanded the gameplay with multiple playable characters, each with unique abilities and weapons.
"Hexen" also introduced hub-based level design, where players could revisit areas and solve puzzles across different levels, which was a significant departure from the more linear progression found in "Doom" and "Heretic."
The "Heretic" series is often praised for its atmospheric level design, which includes environments such as ancient catacombs, haunted castles, and twisted dungeons, all of which are brought to life with detailed textures and eerie sound effects.
